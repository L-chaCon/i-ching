 To go beyond his situation.

  Comments on the Hexagram
 </h2>
 The image of this hexagram is the mountain, the youngest son of heaven and 
earth. The male principle is at the top because it strives upward by nature; the 
female principle is below, since the direction of its movement has come to its 
normal end.
 In its application to man, the hexagram turns upon the problem of 
achieving a quiet heart. It is very difficult to bring quiet to the heart. While 
Buddhism strives for rest through an ebbing away of all movement in 
nirvana, the Book of Changes holds that rest is merely a state of polarity that 
always posits movement as its complement. Possibly the words of the text 
embody directions for the practice of yoga.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Judgement
 </h3>
 True quiet means keeping still when the time has come to keep still, and 
going forward when the time has come to go forward. In this way rest and 
movement are in agreement with the demands of the time, and thus there is 
light in life.
 The hexagram signifies the end and the beginning of all movement. The 
back is named because in the back are located all the nerve fibers that mediate 
movement. If the movement of these spinal nerves is brought to a standstill, 
the ego, with its restlessness, disappears as it were. When a man has thus 
become calm, he may turn to the outside world. He no longer sees in it the 
struggle and tumult of individual beings, and therefore he has that true peace 
of mind which is needed for understanding the great laws of the universe 
and for acting in harmony with them. Whoever acts from these deep levels 
makes no mistakes.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Image
 </h3>
 The heart thinks constantly. This cannot be changed, but the movements of 
the heart-that is, a man's thoughts-should restrict themselves to the 
immediate situation. All thinking that goes beyond this only makes the heart 
sore.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Lines
 </h3>
 <b>
  The bottom line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Keeping the toes still means halting before one has even begun to move. The 
beginning is the time of few mistakes. At that time one is still in harmony 
with primal innocence. Not yet influenced by obscuring interests and desires, 
one sees things intuitively as they really are. A man who halts at the 
beginning, so long as he has not yet abandoned the truth, finds the right way.
But persisting firmness is needed to keep one from drifting irresolutely.
 <b>
  The 2nd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 The leg cannot move independently; it depends on the movement of the 
body. If a leg is suddenly stopped while the whole body is in vigorous 
motion, the continuing body movement will make one fall.
 The same is true of a man who serves a master stronger than himself. He is 
swept along, and even though he may himself halt on the path of 
wrongdoing, he can no longer check the other in his powerful movement.
Where the master presses forward, the servant, no matter how good his 
intentions, cannot save him.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 3rd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 This refers to enforced quiet. The restless heart is to be subdued by forcible 
means. But fire when it is smothered changes into acrid smoke that 
suffocates as it spreads.
 Therefore, in exercises in meditation and concentration, one ought not to 
try to force results. Rather, calmness must develop naturally out of a state of 
inner composure. If one tries to induce calmness by means of artificial 
rigidity, meditation will lead to very unwholesome results.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 4th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 As has been pointed out above in the comment on the Judgment, keeping the 
back at rest means forgetting the ego. This is the highest stage of rest. Here 
this stage has not yet been reached: the individual in this instance, though 
able to keep the ego, with its thoughts and impulses, in a state of rest, is not 
yet quite liberated from its dominance. Nonetheless, keeping the heart at rest 
is an important function, leading in the end to the complete elimination of 
egotistic drives. Even though at this point one does not yet remain free from 
all the dangers of doubt and unrest, this frame of mind is not a mistake, as it 
leads ultimately to that other, higher level.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 5th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 A man in a dangerous situation, especially when he is not adequate to it, is 
inclined to be very free with talk and presumptuous jokes. But injudicious 
speech easily leads to situations that subsequently give much cause for regret.
However, if a man is reserved in speech, his words take ever more definite 
form, and every occasion for regret vanishes.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The top line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 This marks the consummation of the effort to attain tranquillity. One is at 
rest, not merely in a small, circumscribed way in regard to matters of detail, 
but one has also a general resignation in regard to life as a whole, and this 
confers peace and good fortune in relation to every individual matter.

 <h3>
  Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
 </h3>
 Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

 <h2>
  Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
 </h2>
 It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work — when they're not identical.
 Since these two are identical, it makes more sense to compare with the hexagram that has reversed lines (see below).
 <br/>

  Compare to the Reversed Lines
 </h2>
 You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
