        Comments on the Hexagram
    </h2>
    The hexagram represents the sun rising over the earth. It is therefore the 
symbol of rapid, easy progress, which at the same time means ever widening 
expansion and clarity.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Judgement
    </h3>
    As an example of progress, this pictures a time when a powerful feudal lord 
rallies the other lords around the sovereign and pledges fealty and peace. The 
sovereign rewards him richly and invites him to a closer intimacy.

 A twofold idea is set forth here. The actual effect of the progress emanates 
from a man who is in a dependent position and whom the others regard as 
their equal and are therefore willing to follow. This leader has enough clarity 
of vision not to abuse his great influence but to use it rather for the benefit of 
his ruler. His ruler in turn is free of all jealousy, showers presents on the 
great man, and invites him continually to his court. An enlightened ruler 
and an obedient servant — this is the condition on which great progress 
depends.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Image
    </h3>
    The light of the sun rises over the earth is by nature clear. The higher the sun 
rises, the more it emerges from the dark mists, spreading the pristine purity 
of its rays over an ever widening area. The real nature of man is likewise 
originally good, but it becomes clouded by contact with earthly things and 
therefore needs purification before it can shine forth in its native clarity.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Lines
    </h3>
    <b>
        The bottom line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    At a time when all elements are pressing for progress, we are still uncertain 
whether in the course of advance we may not meet with a rebuff. Then the 
thing to do is simply continue in what is right; in the end this will bring good 
fortune. It may be that we meet with no confidence. In this case we ought not 
to try to win confidence regardless of the situation, but should remain calm 
and cheerful and refuse to be roused to anger. Thus we remain free of 
mistakes.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 2nd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    Progress is halted; an individual is kept from getting in touch with the man 
in authority with whom he has a connection. When this happens, he must 
remain persevering, although he is grieved; then with a maternal gentleness 
the man in question will bestow great happiness upon him. This happiness 
comes to him-and is well deserved-because in this case mutual attraction does 
not rest on selfish or partisan motives but on firm and correct principles.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 3rd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    A man strives onward, in association with others whose backing encourages 
him. This dispels any cause for regret over the fact that he does not have 
enough independence to triumph unaided over every hostile turn of fate.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 4th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    In times of progress it is easy for strong men in the wrong places to amass 
great possessions. But such conduct shuns the light. And since times of 
progress are inevitably brought to the light, perseverance in such action 
always leads to danger.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 5th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    The situation described here is that of one who, finding himself in an 
influential position in a time of progress, remains gentle and reserved. He 
might reproach himself for lack of energy in making the most of the 
propitiousness of the time and obtaining all possible advantage. However, 
this regret passes away. He must not take either loss or gain to heart; they are 
minor considerations. What matters much more is the fact that in this way 
he has assured himself of opportunities for successful and beneficent 
influence.
    <b>
        The top line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    Making progress with lowered horns-i.e., acting on the offensive-is 
permissible, in times like those referred to here, only in dealing with the 
mistakes of one's own people. Even then we must bear in mind that 
proceeding on the offensive may always be dangerous. In this way we avoid 
the mistakes that otherwise threaten, and succeed in what we set out to do.
On the other hand, perseverance in such over energetic behavior, especially 
toward persons with whom there is no close connection, will lead to 
humiliation.

    <h3>
        Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
    </h3>
    Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

    <h2>
        Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
    </h2>
    It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work — when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

    You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
