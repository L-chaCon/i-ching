        Comments on the Hexagram
    </h2>
    This hexagram consists of a doubling of the trigram K'an. It is one of the 
eight hexagrams in which doubling occurs. The trigram K'an means a 
plunging in. A yang line has plunged in between two yin lines and is closed 
in by them like water in a ravine. The trigram K'an is also the middle son.
The Receptive has obtained the middle line of the Creative, and thus K'an 
develops. As an image it represents water, the water that comes from above 
and is in motion on earth in streams and rivers, giving rise to all life on 
earth.
    In man's world K'an represents the heart, the soul locked up within the 
body, the principle of light inclosed in the dark — that is, reason. The name of 
the hexagram, because the trigram is doubled, has the additional meaning, 
"repetition of danger." Thus the hexagram is intended to designate an 
objective situation to which one must become accustomed, not a subjective 
attitude. For danger due to a subjective attitude means either foolhardiness 
or guile. Hence too a ravine is used to symbolize danger; it is a situation in 
which a man is in the same pass as the water in a ravine, and, like the water, 
he can escape if he behaves correctly.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Judgement
    </h3>
    Through repetition of danger we grow accustomed to it. Water sets the 
example for the right conduct under such circumstances. It flows on and on, 
and merely fills up all the places through which it flows; it does not shrink 
from any dangerous spot nor from any plunge, and nothing can make it lose 
its own essential nature. It remains true to itself under all conditions. Thus 
likewise, if one is sincere when confronted with difficulties, the heart can 
penetrate the meaning of the situation. And once we have gained inner 
mastery of a problem, it will come about naturally that the action we take will 
succeed. In danger all that counts is really carrying out all that has to be done-
-thoroughness — and going forward, in order not to perish through tarrying in 
the danger.
    Properly used, danger can have an important meaning as a protective 
measure. Thus heaven has its perilous height protecting it against every 
attempt at invasion, and earth has its mountains and bodies of water, 
separating countries by their dangers. Thus also rulers make use of danger to 
protect themselves against attacks from without and against turmoil within.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Image
    </h3>
    Water reaches its goal by flowing continually. It fills up every depression 
before it flows on. The superior man follows its example; he is concerned 
that goodness should be an established attribute of character rather than an 
accidental and isolated occurrence. So likewise in teaching others everything 
depends on consistency, for it is only through repetition that the pupil makes 
the material his own.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Lines
    </h3>
    <b>
        The bottom line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    By growing used to what is dangerous, a man can easily allow it to become 
part of him. He is familiar with it and grows used to evil. With this he has 
lost the right way, and misfortune is the natural result.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 2nd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    When we are in danger we ought not to attempt to get out of it immediately, 
regardless of circumstances; at first we must content ourselves with not being 
overcome by it. We must calmly weigh the conditions of the time and by 
satisfied with small gains, because for the time being a great success cannot be 
attained. A spring flows only sparingly at first, and tarries for some time 
before it makes its way in to the open.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 3rd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    Here every step, forward or backward, leads into danger. Escape is out of the 
question. Therefore we must not be misled into action, as a result of which 
we should only bog down deeper in the danger; disagreeable as it may be to 
remain in such a situation, we must wait until a way out shows itself.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 4th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    In times of danger ceremonious forms are dropped. What matters most is 
sincerity. Although as a rule it is customary for an official to present certain 
introductory gifts and recommendations before he is appointed, here 
everything is simplified to the utmost. The gifts are insignificant, there is no 
one to sponsor him, he introduces himself; yet all this need not be 
humiliating if only there is the honest intention of mutual help in danger.
Still another idea is suggested. The window is the place through which light 
enters the room. If in difficult times we want to enlighten someone, we must 
begin with that which is in itself lucid and proceed quite simply from that 
point on.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 5th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    Danger comes because one is too ambitious. In order to flow out of a ravine, 
water does not rise higher than the lowest point of the rim. So likewise a 
man when in danger has only to proceed along the line of least resistance; 
thus he reaches the goal. Great labors cannot be accomplished in such times; it 
is enough to get out of the danger.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The top line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    A man who in the extremity of danger has lost the right way and is 
irremediably entangled in his sins has no prospect of escape. He is like a 
criminal who sits shackled behind thorn hedged prison walls.

        Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
    </h3>
    Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

        Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
    </h2>
    It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work — when they're not identical.
    Since these two are identical, it makes more sense to compare with the hexagram that has reversed lines (see below).
    <br/>
    <h2>
        Compare to the Reversed Lines
    </h2>
    You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
