        Comments on the Hexagram
    </h2>
    This hexagram is composed of the trigram Li above, i.e., flame, which burns 
upward, and Tui below, i.e., the lake, which seeps downward. These two 
movements are indirect contrast. Furthermore, LI is the second daughter and 
Tui the youngest daughter, and although they live in the same house they 
belong to different men; hence their wills are not the same but are 
divergently directed.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Judgement
    </h3>
    When people live in opposition and estrangement they cannot carry out a 
great undertaking in common; their points of view diverge too widely. In 
such circumstances one should above all not proceed brusquely, for that 
would only increase the existing opposition; instead, one should limit oneself 
to producing gradual effects in small matters. Here success can still be 
expected, because the situation is such that the opposition does not preclude 
all agreement.
    In general, opposition appears as an obstruction, but when it represents 
polarity within a comprehensive whole, it has also its useful and important 
functions. The oppositions of heaven and earth, spirit and nature, man and 
woman, when reconciled, bring about the creation and reproduction of life.
In the world of visible things, the principle of opposites makes possible the 
differentiation by categories through which order is brought into the world.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Image
    </h3>
    .

The two elements, fire and water, never mingle but even when in contact 
retain their own natures. So the sutured man is never led into baseness or 
vulgarity through intercourse or community of interests with persons of 
another sort; regardless of all commingling, he will always preserve his 
individuality.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Lines
    </h3>
    <b>
        The bottom line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    Even in times when oppositions prevail, mistakes can be avoided, so that 
remorse disappears. When opposition begins to manifest itself, a man must 
not try to bring about unity by force, for by so doing he would only achieve 
the contrary, just as a horse goes farther and farther away if one runs after it.
It it is one's won horse, one can safely let it go; it will come back of its own 
accord. So too when someone who belongs with us is momentarily estranged 
because of a misunderstanding, he will return of his own accord if we leave 
matters to him. One the other hand, it is well to be cautious when evil men 
who do not belong with us force themselves upon us, again as the result of a 
misunderstanding. Here the important thing is to avoid mistakes. We must 
not try to shake off these evil men by force; this would give rise to real 
hostility. We must simply endure them. They will eventually withdraw of 
their own accord.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 2nd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    As a result of misunderstandings, it has become impossible for people who by 
nature belong together to meet in the correct way. This being so, an accidental 
meeting under informal circumstances may serve the purpose, provided 
there is an inner affinity between them.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 3rd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    Often it seems tot a man as though everything were conspiring against him.
He sees himself checked and hindered in his progress, insulted and 
dishonored. However, he must not let himself be misled; despite this 
opposition, he must cleave to the man with whom he knows he belongs.
Thus, notwithstanding the bad beginning, the matter will end well.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 4th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    If a man finds himself in a company of people from whom he is separated by 
an inner opposition, he becomes isolated. But if in such a situation a man 
meets someone who fundamentally by the very law of his being, is kin to 
him, and whom he can trust completely, he overcomes all the dangers of 
isolation. His will achieves its aim, and he becomes free of faults.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 5th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    Coming upon a sincere man, one fails to recognize him at first because of the 
general estrangement. However, he bites his way through the wrappings that 
are causing the separation. When such a companion thus reveals himself in 
his true character, it is one's duty to go to meet him and to work with him.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The top line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    Here the isolation is due to misunderstanding; it is brought about not by 
outer circumstances but by inner conditions. A man misjudges his best 
friends, taking them to be as unclean as a dirty pig in and as dangerous as a 
wagon full of devils. He adopts an attitude of defense. But in the end, 
realizing his mistake, he lays aside the bow, perceiving that the other is 
approaching with the best intentions for the purpose of close union. Thus the 
tension is relieved. The union resolves the tension, just as falling rain 
relieves the sultriness preceding a thunderstorm. All goes well, for just when 
opposition reaches its climax it changes over to its antithesis.

    <h3>
        Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
    </h3>
    Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

    <h2>
        Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
    </h2>
    It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work â€” when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

    You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
