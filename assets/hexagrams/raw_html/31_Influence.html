        Comments on the Hexagram
    </h2>
    The name of the hexagram means "universal," "general," and in a figurative 
sense "to influence," "to stimulate." The upper trigram is Tui, the Joyous; the 
lower is Kên, Keeping still. By its persistent, quiet influence, the lower, rigid 
trigram stimulates the upper, weak trigram, which responds to this 
stimulation cheerfully and joyously. Kên, the lower trigram, is the youngest 
son; the upper, Tui, is the youngest daughter. Thus the universal mutual 
attraction between the sexes is represented. In courtship, the masculine 
principle must seize the initiative and place itself below the feminine 
principle.
    Just as the first part of book 1 begins with the hexagrams of heaven and 
earth, the foundations of all that exists, the second part begins with the 
hexagrams of courtship and marriage, the foundations of all social 
relationships.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Judgement
    </h3>
    The weak element is above, the strong below; hence their powers attract each 
other, so that they unite. This brings about success, for all success depends on 
the effect of mutual attraction. By keeping still within while experiencing joy 
without, one can prevent the joy from going to excess and hold it within 
proper bounds. This is the meaning of the added admonition, "Perseverance 
furthers," for it is perseverance that makes the difference between seduction 
and courtship; in the latter the strong man takes a position inferior to that of 
the weak girl and shows consideration for her. This attraction between 
affinities is a general law of nature. Heaven and earth attract each other and 
thus all creatures come into being. Through such attraction the sage 
influences men's hearts, and thus the world attains peace. From the 
attractions they exert we can learn the nature of all beings in heaven and on 
earth.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Image
    </h3>
    A mountain with a lake on its summit is stimulated by the moisture from 
the lake. It has this advantage because its summit does not jut out as a peak 
but is sunken. The image counsels that the mind should be kept humble and 
free, so that it may remain receptive to good advice. People soon give up 
counseling a man who thinks that he knows everything better than anyone 
else.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Lines
    </h3>
    <b>
        The bottom line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    A movement, before it is actually carried out, shows itself first in the toes.
The idea of an influence is already present, but is not immediately apparent to 
others. As long as the intention has no visible effect, it is of no importance to 
the outside world and leads neither to good nor to evil.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 2nd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    In movement, the calf of the leg follows the foot; by itself it can neither go 
forward nor stand still. Since the movement is not self-governed, it bodes ill.
One should wait quietly until one is impelled to action by a real influence.
Then one remains uninjured.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 3rd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    Every mood of the heart influences us to movement. What the heart desires, 
the thighs run after without a moment's hesitation; they hold to the heart, 
which they follow. In the life of man, however, acting on the spur of every 
caprice is wrong and if continued leads to humiliation. Three considerations 
suggest themselves here. First, a man should not run precipitately after all the 
persons whom he would like to influence, but must be able to hold back 
under certain circumstances. As little should he yield immediately to every 
whim of those in whose service he stands. Finally, where the moods of his 
own heart are concerned, he should never ignore the possibility of inhibition, 
for this is the basis of human freedom.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 4th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    Here the place of the heart is reached. The impulse that springs from this 
source is the most important of all. It is of particular concern that this 
influence be constant and good; then, in spite of the danger arising from the 
great susceptibility of the human heart, there will be no cause for remorse.
When the quiet power of a man's own character is at work, the effects 
produced are right. All those who are receptive to the vibrations of such a 
spirit will then be influenced. Influence over others should not express itself 
as a conscious and willed effort to manipulate them. Through practicing such 
conscious incitement, one becomes wrought up and is exhausted by the 
eternal stress and strain. Moreover, the effects produced are then limited to 
those on whom one's thoughts are consciously fixed.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 5th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    The back of the neck is the most rigid part of the body. When the influence 
shows itself there, the will remains firm and the influence does not lead to 
confusion. Hence remorse does not enter into consideration here. What 
takes place in the depths of one's being, in the unconscious mind. It is true 
that if we cannot be influenced ourselves, we cannot influence the outside 
world.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The top line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    The most superficial way of trying to influence others is through talk that has 
nothing real behind it. The influence produced by such mere tongue wagging 
must necessarily remain insignificant. Hence no indication is added 
regarding good or bad fortune.

        Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
    </h3>
    Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

        Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
    </h2>
    It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work — when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

    You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
