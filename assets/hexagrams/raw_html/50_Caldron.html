        Comments on the Hexagram
    </h2>
    The six lines construct the image of Ting, THE CALDRON; at the bottom are 
the legs, over them the belly, then come the ears (handles), and at the top the 
carrying rings. At the same time, the image suggests the idea of nourishment.
The ting, cast of bronze, was the vessel that held the cooked viands in the 
temple of the ancestors and at banquets. The heads of the family served the 
food from the ting into the bowls of the guests.
    THE WELL (48) likewise has the secondary meaning of giving nourishment, 
but rather more in relation to the people. The ting, as a utensil pertaining to 
a refined civilization, suggests the fostering and nourishing of able men, 
which redounded to the benefit of the state.
    This hexagram and THE WELL are the only two in the Book of Changes that 
represent concrete, men-made objects. Yet here too the thought has its 
abstract connotation.
    Sun, below, is wood and wind; Li, above, is flame. Thus together they stand 
for the flame kindled by wood and wind, which likewise suggests the idea of 
preparing food.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Judgement
    </h3>
    While THE WELL relates to the social foundation of our life, and this 
foundation is likened to the water that serves to nourish growing wood, the 
present hexagram refers to the cultural superstructure of society. Here it is 
the wood that serves as nourishment for the flame, the spirit. All that is 
visible must grow beyond itself, extend into the realm of the invisible.
Thereby it receives its true consecration and clarity and takes firm root in the 
cosmic order.
    Here we see civilization as it reaches its culmination in religion. The ting 
serves in offering sacrifice to God. The highest earthly values must be 
sacrificed to the divine. But the truly divine does not manifest itself apart 
from man. The supreme revelation of God appears in prophets and holy 
men. To venerate them is true veneration of God. The will of God, as 
revealed through them, should be accepted in humility; this brings inner 
enlightenment and true understanding of the world, and this leads to great 
good fortune and success.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Image
    </h3>
    The fate of fire depends on wood; as long as there is wood below, the fire 
burns above. It is the same in human life; there is in man likewise a fate that 
lends power to his life. And if he succeeds in assigning the right place to life 
and to fate, thus bringing the two into harmony, he puts his fate on a firm 
footing. These words contain hints about fostering of life as handed on by 
oral tradition in the secret teachings of Chinese yoga.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Lines
    </h3>
    <b>
        The bottom line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    If a ting is turned upside down before being used, no harm is done-on the 
contrary, this clears it of refuse. A concubine's position is lowly, but because 
she has a son she comes to be honored.
    These two metaphors express the idea that in a highly developed 
civilization, such as that indicated by this hexagram, every person of good 
will can in some way or other succeed. No matter how lowly he may be, 
provided he is ready to purify himself, he is accepted. He attains a station in 
which he can prove himself fruitful in accomplishment, and as a result he 
gains recognition.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 2nd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    In a period of advanced culture, it is of the greatest importance that one 
should achieve something significant. If a man concentrates on such real 
undertakings, he may indeed experience envy and disfavor, but that is not 
dangerous. The more he limits himself to his actual achievements, the less 
harm the envious inflict on him.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 3rd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    The handle is the means for lifting up the ting. If the handle is altered, the 
ting cannot be lifted up and used, and, sad to say, the delicious food in it, such 
as pheasant fat, cannot be eaten by anyone.
    This describes a man who, in a highly evolved civilization, finds himself in 
a place where no one notices or recognizes him. This is a severe block to his 
effectiveness. All of his good qualities and gifts of mind thus needlessly go to 
waste. But if he will only see to it that he is possessed of something truly 
spiritual, the time is bound to come, sooner or later, when the difficulties will 
be resolved and all will go well. The fall of rain symbolizes here, as in other 
instances, release of tension.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 4th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    A man has a difficult and responsible task to which he is not adequate.
Moreover, he does not devote himself to it with all his strength but goes 
about with inferior people; therefore the execution of the work fails. In this 
way he also incurs personal opprobrium.
    Confucius says about this line: "Weak character coupled with honored 
place, meager knowledge with large plans, limited powers with heavy 
responsibility, will seldom escape disaster."
    <b>
        The 5th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    Here we have, in a ruling position, a man who is approachable and modest in 
nature. As a result of this attitude he succeeds in finding strong and able 
helpers who complement and aid him in his work. Having achieved this 
attitude, which requires constant self-abnegation, it is important for him to 
hold to it and not to let himself be led astray.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The top line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    In the preceding line the carrying rings are described as golden, to denote their 
strength; here they are said to be of jade. Jade is notable for its combination of 
hardness with soft luster. This counsel, in relation to the man who is open to 
it, works greatly t his advantage. Here the counsel is described in relation to 
the sage who imparts it. In imparting it, he will be mild and pure, like 
precious jade. Thus the work finds favor in the eyes of the Deity, who 
dispenses great good fortune, and becomes pleasing to men, wherefore all 
goes well.

    <h3>
        Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
    </h3>
    Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

        Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
    </h2>
    It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work â€” when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

    You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
