        Comments on the Hexagram
    </h2>
    The great lines, that is, the light, strong lines, are powerful. Four light lines 
have entered the hexagram from below and are about to ascend higher. The 
upper trigram is Chên, the Arousing; the lower is ch'ien, the Creative.
Ch'ien is strong, Chên produces movement. The union of movement and 
strength gives the meaning of THE POWER OF THE GREAT. The hexagram 
is linked with the second month (March-April).
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Judgement
    </h3>
    The hexagram points to a time when inner worth mounts with great force 
and comes to power. But its strength has already passed beyond the median 
line, hence there is danger that one may rely entirely on one's own power 
and forget to ask what is right. There is danger too that, being intent on 
movement, we may not wait for the right time. Therefore the added 
statement that perseverance furthers. For that is truly great power which does 
not degenerate into mere force but remains inwardly united with the 
fundamental principles of right and of justice. When we understand this 
point — namely, that greatness and justice must be indissolubly united — we 
understand the true meaning of all that happens in heaven and on earth.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Image
    </h3>
    Thunder — electrical energy — mounts upward in the spring. The direction of 
this movement is in harmony with that of the movement of heaven. It is 
therefore a movement in accord with heaven, producing great power.
However, true greatness depends on being in harmony with what is right.
Therefore in times of great power the superior man avoids doing anything 
that is not in harmony with the established order.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Lines
    </h3>
    <b>
        The bottom line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    The toes are in the lowest place and are ready to advance. So likewise great 
power in lowly station is inclined to effect advance by force. This, if carried 
further, would certainly lead to misfortune, and therefore by way of advice a 
warning is added.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 2nd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    The premise here is that the gates to success are beginning to open.
Resistance gives way and we forge ahead. This is the point at which, only too 
easily, we become the prey of exuberant self-confidence. This is why the 
oracle says that perseverance (i.e., perseverance in inner equilibrium, without 
excessive use of power) brings good fortune.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 3rd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    Making a boast of power leads to entanglements, just as a goat entangles its 
horns when it butts against a hedge. Whereas an inferior man revels in 
power when he comes into possession of it, the superior man never makes 
this mistake. He is conscious at all times of the danger of pushing ahead 
regardless of circumstances, and therefore renounces in good time the empty 
display of force.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 4th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    If a man goes on quietly and perseveringly working at the removal of 
resistances, success comes in the end. The obstructions give way and all 
occasion for remorse arising from excessive use of power disappears.

Such a man's power does not show externally, yet it can move heavy loads, 
like a big cart whose real strength lies in its axle. The less that power is 
applied outwardly, the greater its effect.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 5th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    The goat is noted for hardness outwardly and weakness within. Now the 
situation is such that everything is easy; there is no more resistance. One can 
give up a belligerent, stubborn way of acting and will not have to regret it.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The top line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    If we venture too far we come to a deadlock, unable either to advance or to 
retreat and whatever we do merely serves to complicate thing further. Such 
obstinacy leads to insuperable difficulties. But if, realizing the situation, we 
compose ourselves and decide not to continue, everything will right itself in 
time.

    <h3>
        Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
    </h3>
    Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

    <h2>
        Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
    </h2>
    It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work — when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

    You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
