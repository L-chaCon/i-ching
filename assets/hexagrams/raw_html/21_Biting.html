        Comments on the Hexagram
    </h2>
    This hexagram represents an open mouth (cf. hexagram 27) with an 
obstruction (in the fourth place) between the teeth. As a result the lips cannot 
meet. To bring them together one must bite energetically through the 
obstacle. Since the hexagram is made up of the trigrams for thunder and for 
lightning, it indicates how obstacles are forcibly removed in nature. 
Energetic biting through overcomes the obstacle that prevents joining of the 
lips; the storm with its thunder and lightning overcomes the disturbing 
tension in nature. Recourse to law and penalties overcomes the disturbances 
of harmonious social life caused by criminals and slanderers. The theme of 
this hexagram is a criminal lawsuit, in contradistinction to that of Sung, 
CONFLICT (6), which refers to civil suits.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Judgement
    </h3>
    When an obstacle to union arises, energetic biting through brings success.
This is true in all situations. Whenever unity cannot be established, the 
obstruction is due to a talebearer and traitor who is interfering and blocking 
the way. To prevent permanent injury, vigorous measures must be taken at 
once. Deliberate obstruction of this sort does not vanish of its own accord.
Judgment and punishment are required to deter or obviate it.
    However, it is important to proceed in the right way. The hexagram 
combines Li, clarity, and Chên, excitement. Li is yielding, Chên is hard.
Unqualified hardness and excitement would be too violent in meting out 
punishment; unqualified clarity and gentleness would be too weak. The two 
together create the just measure. It is of moment that the man who makes 
the decisions (represented by the fifth line) is gentle by nature, while he 
commands respect by his conduct in his position.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Image
    </h3>
    Penalties are the individual applications of the law. The laws
specify the penalties. Clarity prevails when mild and severe
penalties are differentiated, according to the nature of the crimes.
This is symbolized by the clarity of lighting. The law is strengthened
by a just application of penalties. This is symbolized by the terror
of thunder. This clarity and severity have the effect of instilling
respect; it is not that the penalties are ends in themselves.
The obstructions in the social life of man increase when there is a
lack of clarity in the penal codes and slackness in executing them.
The only to strengthen the law is to make it clear and make penalties
certain and swift.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Lines
    </h3>
    <b>
        The bottom line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    If a sentence is imposed the first time a man attempts to do wrong, the 
penalty is a mild one. Only the toes are put in the stocks. This prevents him 
from sinning further and thus he becomes free of blame. It is a warning to 
halt in time on the path of evil.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 2nd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    It is easy to discriminate between right and wrong in this case;
it is like biting through tender meat. But one encounters a
hardened sinner, and, aroused by anger, one goes a little too
far. The disappearance of the nose in the course of the bite
signifies that indignation blots out finer sensibility. However,
there is no great harm in this, because the penalty as such is
just.
    <b>
        The 3rd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    Punishment is to be carried out by someone who lacks the power and 
authority to do so. Therefore the culprits do not submit. The matter at issue 
is an old one-as symbolized by salted game-and in dealing with it difficulties 
arise. This old meat is spoiled: by taking up the problem the punisher arouses 
poisonous hatred against himself, and n this way is put in a somewhat 
humiliating position. But since punishment was required by the time, he 
remains free of blame.
    <b>
        The 4th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    There are great obstacles to be overcome, powerful opponents are to be 
punished. Though this is arduous, the effort succeeds. But it is necessary to 
be hard as metal and straight as an arrow to surmount the difficulties. If one 
knows these difficulties and remains persevering, he attains good fortune.
The difficult task is achieved in the end.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 5th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    The case to be decided is indeed not easy but perfectly clear. Since we 
naturally incline to leniency, we must make every effort to be like yellow 
gold-that is, as true as gold and as impartial as yellow, the color of the middle 
[the mean]. It is only by remaining conscious of the dangers growing out of 
the responsibility we have assumed that we can avoid making mistakes.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The top line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    In contrast to the first line, this line refers to a man who is incorrigible. His 
punishment is the wooden cangue, and his ears disappear under it-that is to 
say, he is deaf to warnings. This obstinacy leads to misfortune.

        Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
    </h3>
    Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

        Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
    </h2>
    It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work — when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

    You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
