        Comments on the Hexagram
    </h2>
    This hexagram indicates a situation in which the principle of darkness, after 
having been eliminated, furtively and unexpectedly obtrudes again from 
within and below. Of its own accord the female principle comes to meet the 
male. It is an unfavorable and dangerous situation, and we must understand 
and promptly prevent the possible consequences.
    The hexagram is linked with the fifth month [June-July], because at the 
summer solstice the principle of darkness gradually becomes ascendant again.
    <h3>
        The Judgement
    </h3>
    The rise of the inferior element is pictured here in the image of a bold girl 
who lightly surrenders herself and thus seizes power. This would not be 
possible if the strong and light-giving element had not in turn come halfway.
The inferior thing seems so harmless and inviting that a man delights in it; it 
looks so small and weak that he imagines he may dally with it and come to 
no harm.
    The inferior man rises only because the superior man does not regard him 
as dangerous and so lends him power. If he were resisted from the fist, he 
could never gain influence.
    The time of COMING TO MEET is important in still another way.
Although as a general rule the weak should not come to meet the strong, 
there are times when this has great significance. When heaven and earth 
come to meet each other, all creatures prosper; when a prince and his official 
come to meet each other, the world is put in order. It is necessary for 
elements predestined to be joined and mutually dependent to come to meet 
one another halfway. But the coming together must be free of dishonest 
ulterior motives, otherwise harm will result.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Image
    </h3>
    The situation here resembles that in hexagram 20, Kuan, CONTEMPLATION 
(VIEW). In the latter the wind blows over the earth, here it blows under 
heaven; in both cases it goes everywhere. There the wind is on the earth and 
symbolizes the ruler taking note of the conditions in his kingdom; here the 
wind blows from above and symbolizes the influence exercised by the ruler 
through his commands. Heaven is far from the things of earth, but it sets 
them in motion by means of the wind. The ruler is far from his people, but 
he sets them in motion by means of his commands and decrees.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Lines
    </h3>
    <b>
        The bottom line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    If an inferior element has wormed its way in, it must be energetically checked 
at once. By consistently checking it, bad effects can be avoided. If it is allowed 
to take its course, misfortune is bound to result; the insignificance of that 
which creeps in should not be a temptation to underrate it. A pig that is still 
young and lean cannot rage around much, but after it has eaten its fill and 
become strong, its true nature comes out if it has not previously been curbed.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 2nd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    The inferior element is not overcome by violence but is kept under gentle 
control. Then nothing evil is to be feared. But care must be taken not to let it 
come in contact with those further away, because once free it would unfold its 
evil aspects unchecked.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 3rd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    There is a temptation to fall in with the evil element offering itself-a very 
dangerous situation. Fortunately circumstances prevent this; one would like 
to do it, but cannot. This leads to painful indecision in behavior. But if we 
gain clear insight into the danger of the situation, we shall at least avoid more 
serious mistakes.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 4th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    Insignificant people must be tolerated in order to keep them well disposed.
Then we can make use of them if we should need them. If we become 
alienated from them and do not meet them halfway, they turn their backs on 
us and are not at our disposal when we need them. But this is our own fault.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 5th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    The melon, like the fish, is a symbol of the principle of darkness. It is sweet 
but spoils easily and for this reason is protected with a cover of willow leaves.
This is a situation in which a strong, superior, well-poised man tolerates and 
protects the inferiors in his charge. He has the firm lines of order an beauty 
within himself but he does not lay stress upon them. He does not bother his 
subordinates with outward show or tiresome admonitions but leaves them 
quite free, putting his trust in the transforming power of a strong and upright 
personality. And behold! Fate is favorable. His inferiors respond to his 
influence and fall to his disposition like ripe fruit.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The top line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    When a man has withdrawn from the world, its tumult often becomes 
unbearable to him. There are many people who in a noble pride hold 
themselves aloof from all that is low and rebuff it brusquely wherever it 
comes to meet them. Such persons are reproached for being proud and 
distant, but since active duties no longer hold them to the world, this does 
not greatly matter. They know how to bear the dislike of the masses with 
composure.

    <h3>
        Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
    </h3>
    Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:
    <br/>
    <h2>
        Heaven upon Wind
    </h2>
    This hexagram is a summary of the sky: From heaven comes the wind, which reaches and disturbs the world below it. Heaven is the highest and mightiest. Since it is fixed high above us, it acts by wind.
    This image is similar to the Japanese concept of
    <i>
        kamikaze
    </i>
    , the wind of the gods. Ultimately, according to many ancient mythologies, heaven rules all from high above. The wind is a major force at its disposal. It acts out the will of its high origin.
    Any wind is a wind of change. It creates movements in the world, movements with a direction and an outcome. Since its starting point is heaven, the direction of it is what ancient China described as
    <i>
        tien tao
    </i>
    , heaven's way. The wind shows heavenly intentions. Or as Taoism would have it: the way of nature, which is indifferent to human will and independent of it.
    We might want to call it chance, but in ancient Chinese cosmology there was no such thing. Any event had a purpose — human if caused by humans, heaven's if caused by natural phenomena. Anyway, this hexagrams points to processes over which we have little or no control.
    That is why this hexagram is sort of a warning signal when appearing in a reading. If heaven sends this powerful messenger to us, we should be attentive to what is being said, what path is suggested. After all, the wind is as close to contact with heaven as earthbound creatures can hope to come. The ruler speaks its mind to its subjects. We had better listen closely before doing anything at all.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        Yin and Yang Significances
    </h3>
    In this hexagram, only the bottom line is Yin (broken), whereas all the five lines above it are Yang (full). So, this is definitely a Yang dominated sign. Still, the bottom line is one of fundamental importance, wherefore it cannot be neglected.
    It is natural that Yin, like earth, is below heavenly Yang. But although heaven is traditionally regarded as so much grander in every way than the earth, the extreme unbalance between Yin and Yang is seen with some concern. That is why the hexagram speaks of caution. Something is not as it should be.
    When the earthly is suppressed by so much heavenly, then procreation and the fruition of the earth are burdened. Also, the system of the world, as well as that of any of its creatures, is disturbed by the unbalance between Yin and Yang. The world needs darkness as well as light, and cold as well as heat. Otherwise conditions may get to be extreme.
    When this hexagram appears in a reading, it is cause for pondering the matter carefully. What may seem overwhelmingly good at the light of day can prove strenuous already at the moment of dusk. Things are not as good as they seem to be in all their superficial glory. So, one should hesitate instead of jumping to conclusions, reconsider instead of hurrying to decide on the first impression.

    <h2>
        Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
    </h2>
    It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work — when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

    You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
