        Comments on the Hexagram
    </h2>
    This hexagram is related in form and meaning to Pi, HOLDING TOGETHER 
(8). In the latter, water is over the earth; here a lake is over the earth. But 
since the lake is a place where water collects, the idea of gathering together is 
even more strongly expressed here than in the other hexagram. The same 
idea also arises from the fact that in the present case it is two strong lines (the 
fourth and the fifth) that bring about the gather together, whereas in the 
former case one strong line (the fifth) stands in the midst of weak lines.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Judgement
    </h3>
    The gathering together of people in large communities is either a natural 
occurrence, as in the case of the family, or an artificial one, as in the case of 
the state. The family gathers about the father as its head. The perpetuation of 
this gathering in groups is achieved through the sacrifice to the ancestors, at 
which the whole clan is gathered together. Through the collective piety of 
the living members of the family, the ancestors become so integrated in the 
spiritual life of the family that it cannot be dispersed or dissolved.
    Where men are to be gathered together, religious forces are needed. But 
there must also be a human leader to serve as the center of the group. In 
order to be able to bring others together, this leader must first of all be 
collected within himself. Only collective moral force can unite the world.
Such great times of unification will leave great achievements behind them.
This is the significance of the great offerings that are made. In the secular 
sphere likewise there is no need of great deeds in the time of GATHERING 
TOGETHER.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Image
    </h3>
    If the water in the lake gathers until it rises above the earth, there is danger of 
a break-through. Precautions must be taken to prevent this. Similarly where 
men gather together in great numbers, strife is likely to arise; where 
possessions are collected, robbery is likely to occur. Thus in the time of 
GATHERING TOGETHER we must arm promptly to ward off the unexpected.
Human woes usually come as a result of unexpected events against which we 
are not forearmed. If we are prepared, they can be prevented.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Lines
    </h3>
    <b>
        The bottom line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    The situation is this: People desire to gather around a leader to whom they 
look up. But they are in a large group, by which they allow themselves to be 
influenced, so that they waver in their decision. Thus they lack a firm center 
around which to gather. But if expression is given to this need, and if they 
call for help, one grasp of the hand from the leader is enough to turn away all 
distress. Therefore they must not allow themselves to be led astray. It is 
undoubtedly right that they should attach themselves to this leader.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 2nd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    In the time of GATHERING TOGETHER, we should make no arbitrary choice 
of the way. There are secret forces at work, leading together those who belong 
together. We must yield to this attraction; then we make no mistakes.
Where inner relationships exist, no great preparations and formalities are 
necessary. People understand one another forthwith, just as the Divinity 
graciously accepts a small offering if it comes from the heart.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 3rd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    Often a man feels an urge to unite with others, but the individuals around 
him have already formed themselves into a group, so that he remains 
isolated. The whole situation proves untenable. Then he ought to choose 
the way of progress, resolutely allying himself with a man who stands nearer 
to the center of the group, and can help him to gain admission to the closed 
circle. This is not a mistake, even though at first his position as an outsider is 
somewhat humiliating.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 4th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    This describes a man who gathers people around him in the name of his 
ruler. Since he is not striving for any special advantages for himself but is 
working unselfishly to bring about general unity, his work is crowned with 
success, and everything becomes as it should be.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 5th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    When people spontaneously gather around a man, it is only a good. It gives 
him a certain influence that can be altogether useful.. But of course there is 
also the possibility that many may gather around him not because of a feeling 
of confidence but merely because of his influential position. This is certainly 
to be regretted. The only means of dealing with such people is to gain their 
confidence through steadfastness an intensified, unswerving devotion to 
duty. In this way secret mistrust will gradually be overcome, and there will be 
no occasion for regret.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The top line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    It may happen that an individual would like to ally himself with another, but 
his good intentions are misunderstood. Then he becomes sad and laments.
But this is the right course. For it may cause the other person to come to his 
senses, so that the alliance that has been sought and so painfully missed is 
after all achieved.

    <h3>
        Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
    </h3>
    Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

        Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
    </h2>
    It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work â€” when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

    You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
