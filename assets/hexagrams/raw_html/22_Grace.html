        Comments on the Hexagram
    </h2>
    This hexagram shows a fire that breaks out of the secret depths of the earth 
and, blazing up, illuminates and beautifies the mountain, the heavenly 
heights. Grace-beauty of form-is necessary in any union if it is to be well 
ordered and pleasing rather than disordered and chaotic.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Judgement
    </h3>
    Grace brings success. However, it is not the essential or fundamental thing; it 
is only the ornament and therefore be used sparingly and only in little things.
In the lower trigram of fire a yielding line comes between two strong lines 
and makes them beautiful, but the strong lines are the essential content and 
the weak line is the beautifying form. In the upper trigram of the mountain, 
the strong line takes the lead, so that here again the strong element must be 
regarded as the decisive factor. In nature we see in the sky the strong light of 
the sun; the life of the world depends on it. But this strong, essential thing is 
changed and given pleasing variety by the moon and the stars. In human 
affairs, aesthetic form comes into being when traditions exist that, strong and 
abiding like mountains, are made pleasing by a lucid beauty. By 
contemplating the forms existing in the heavens we come to understand time 
and its changing demands. Through contemplation of the forms existing in 
human society it becomes possible to shape the world.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Image
    </h3>
    The fire, whose light illuminates the mountain and makes it pleasing, does 
not shine far; in the same way, beautiful form suffices to brighten and to 
throw light upon matters of lesser moment, but important questions cannot 
be decided in this way. They require greater earnestness.
    <h3>
        The Lines
    </h3>
    <b>
        The bottom line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    A beginner in subordinate place must take upon himself the labor of 
advancing. There might be an opportunity of surreptitiously easing the way-
symbolized by the carriage-but a self-contained man scorns help gained in a 
dubious fashion. He thinks it more graceful to go on foot than to drive in a 
carriage under false pretenses.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 2nd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    The beard is not an independent thing; it moves only with the chin. The 
image therefore means that form is to be considered only as a result and 
attribute of content. The beard is a superfluous ornament. To devote care to it 
for its own sake, without regard for the inner content of which it is an 
ornament, would bespeak a certain vanity.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 3rd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    This represents a very charming life situation. One is under the spell of grace 
and the mellow mood induced by wine. This grace can adorn, but it can also 
swamp us. Hence the warning not to sink into convivial indolence but to 
remain constant in perseverance. Good fortune depends on this.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 4th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    An individual is in a situation in which doubts arise as to which is better-to 
pursue the grace of external brilliance, or to return to simplicity. The doubt 
itself implies the answer. Confirmation comes from the outside; it comes like 
a white winged horse. The white color indicates simplicity. At first it may be 
disappointing to renounce the comforts that might have been obtained, yet 
one finds peace of mind in a true relationship with the friend who courts 
him. The winged horse is the symbol of the thoughts that transcend all limits 
of space and time.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 5th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    A man withdraws from contact with people of the lowlands, who seek 
nothing but magnificence and luxury, in to the solitude of the heights. There 
he finds an individual to look up to, whom he would like to have as a friend.
But the gifts he has to offer are poor and few, so that he feels ashamed.
However, it is not the material gifts that count, but sincerity of feeling, and so 
all goes well in the end.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The top line marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    Here at the highest stage of development all ornament is discarded. Form no 
longer conceals content but brings out its value to the full. Perfect grace 
consists not in exterior ornamentation of the substance, but in the simple 
fitness of its form.

        Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
    </h3>
    Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

        Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
    </h2>
    It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work — when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

    You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
