        Comments on the Hexagram
    </h2>
    The name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of grass pushing 
against an obstacle as it sprouts out of the earth — hence the meaning, 
"difficulty at the beginning." The hexagram indicates the way in which 
heaven and earth bring forth individual beings. It is their first meeting, 
which is beset with difficulties. The lower trigram Chên is the Arousing; its 
motion is upward and its image is thunder. The upper trigram K'an stands 
for the Abysmal, the dangerous. Its motion is downward and its image is 
rain. The situation points to teeming, chaotic profusion; thunder and rain fill 
the air. But the chaos clears up. While the Abysmal sinks, the upward 
movement eventually passes beyond the danger. A thunderstorm brings 
release from tension, and all things breathe freely again.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Judgement
    </h3>
    Times of growth are beset with difficulties. They resemble a first birth. But 
these difficulties arise from the very profusion of all that is struggling to 
attain form . Everything is in motion: therefore if one perseveres there is a 
prospect of great success, in spite of the existing danger. When it is a man's 
fate to undertake such new beginnings, everything is still unformed, dark.
Hence he must hold back, because any premature move might bring disaster.
Likewise, it is very important not to remain alone; in order to overcome the 
chaos he needs helpers. This is not to say, however, that he himself should 
look on passively at what is happening. He must lend his hand and 
participate with inspiration and guidance.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Image
    </h3>
    Clouds and thunder are represented by definite decorative lines; this means 
that in the chaos of difficulty at the beginning, order is already implicit. So 
too the superior man has to arrange and organize the inchoate profusion of 
such times of beginning, just as one sorts out silk threads from a knotted 
tangle and binds them into skeins. In order to find one's place in the infinity 
of being, one must be able both to separate and to unite.
    <br/>
    <h3>
        The Lines
    </h3>
    If a person encounters a hindrance at the beginning of an enterprise, he must 
not try to force advance but must pause and take thought. However, nothing 
should put him off his course; he must persevere and constantly keep the 
goal in sight. It is important to seek out the right assistants, but he can find 
them only if he avoids arrogance and associated with his fellows in a spirit of 
humility. Only then will he attract those with whose help he can combat the 
difficulties.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 2nd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    We find ourselves beset by difficulties and hindrances. Suddenly there is a 
turn of affairs, as if someone were coming up with a horse and wagon and 
unhitching them. This event comes so unexpectedly that we assume the 
newcomer to be a robber. Gradually it becomes clear that he has no evil 
intentions but seeks to be friendly and to offer help. But this offer is not to be 
accepted, because it does not come from the right quarter. We must wait until 
the time is fulfilled; ten years is a fulfilled cycle of time. Then normal 
conditions return of themselves, and we can join forces with the friend 
intended for us.
    Using the image of a betrothed girl who remains true to her lover in face of 
grave conflicts, the hexagram gives counsel for a special situation. When in 
times of difficulty a hindrance is encountered and unexpected relief is offered 
from a source unrelated to us, we must be careful and not take upon 
ourselves any obligations entailed by such help; otherwise our freedom of 
decision is impaired. If we bide our time, things will quiet down again, and 
we shall attain what we have hoped for.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 3rd line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    If a man tries to hunt in a strange forest and has no guide, he loses his way.
When he finds himself in difficulties he must not try to steal out of them 
unthinkingly and without guidance. Fate cannot be duped; premature effort, 
without the necessary guidance, ends in failure and disgrace. Therefore the 
superior man, discerning the seeds of coming events, prefers to renounce a 
wish rather than to provoke failure and humiliation by trying to force its 
fulfillment.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 4th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    We are in a situation in which it is our duty to act, but we lack sufficient 
power. However, an opportunity to make connections offers itself. It must be 
seized. Neither false pride nor false reserve should deter us. Bringing oneself 
to take the first step, even when it involves a certain degree of self-
abnegation, is a sign of inner clarity. To accept help in a difficult situation is 
not a disgrace. If the right helper is found, all goes well.
    <br/>
    <b>
        The 5th line from the bottom marked
    </b>
    <br/>
    An individual is in a position in which he cannot so express his good 
intentions that they will actually take shape and be understood. Other people 
interpose and distort everything he does. He should then be cautious and 
proceed step by step. He must not try to force the consummation of a great 
undertaking, because success is possible only when general confidence already 
prevails. It is only through faithful and conscientious work, unobtrusively 
carried on, that the situation gradually clears up and the hindrance 
disappears.
    <br/>

    The difficulties at the beginning are too great for some persons. They get 
stuck and never find their way out; they fold their hands and give up the 
struggle. Such resignation is the saddest of all things. Therefore Confucius 
says of this line: "Bloody tears flow: one should not persist in this."

        Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
    </h3>
    Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

        Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
    </h2>
    It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work — when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

    You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
