  Comments on the Hexagram
 </h2>
 This hexagram is another double sign. The trigram Li means "to cling to 
something," and also "brightness." A dark line clings to two light lines, one 
above and one below — the image of an empty space between two strong lines, 
whereby the two strong lines are made bright. The trigram represents the 
middle daughter. The Creative has incorporated the central line of the 
Receptive, and thus Li develops. As an image, it is fire. Fire has no definite 
form but clings to the burning object and thus is bright. As water pours down 
from heaven, so fire flames up from the earth. While K'an means the soul 
shut within the body, Li stands for nature in its radiance.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Judgement
 </h3>
 What is dark clings to what is light and so enhances the brightness of the 
latter. A luminous thing giving out light must have within itself something 
that perseveres; otherwise it will in time burn itself out. Everything that gives 
light is dependent on something to which it clings, in order that it may 
continue to shine.
 Thus the sun and moon cling to heaven, and grain, grass, and trees cling to 
the earth. So too the twofold clarity of the dedicated man clings to what is 
right and thereby can shape the world. Human life on earth is conditioned 
and unfree, and when man recognizes this limitation and makes himself 
dependent upon the harmonious and beneficent forces of the cosmos, he 
achieves success. The cow is the symbol of extreme docility. By cultivating in 
himself an attitude of compliance and voluntary dependence, man acquires 
clarity without sharpness and finds his place in the world.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Image
 </h3>
 Each of the two trigrams represents the sun in the course of a day. The two 
together represent the repeated movement of the sun, the function of light 
with respect to time. The great man continues the work of nature in the 
human world. Through the clarity of his nature he causes the light to spread 
farther and farther and to penetrate the nature of man ever more deeply.
 <h3>
  The Lines
 </h3>
 <b>
  The bottom line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 It is early morning and work begins. The mind has been closed to the outside 
world in sleep; now its connections with the world begin again. The traces of 
one's impressions run crisscross. Activity and haste prevail. It is important 
then to preserve inner composure and not to allow oneself to be swept along 
by the bustle of life. If one is serious and composed, he can acquire the clarity 
of mind needed for coming to terms with the innumerable impressions that 
pour in. It is precisely at the beginning that serious concentration is 
important, because the beginning holds the seed of all that is to follow.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 2nd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Midday has come; the sun shines with a yellow light. Yellow is the color of 
measure and mean. Yellow light is therefore a symbol of the highest culture 
and art, whose consummate harmony consists in holding to the mean.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 3rd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Here the end of the day has come. The light of the setting sun calls to mind 
the fact that life is transitory and conditional. Caught in this external 
bondage, men are usually robbed of their inner freedom as well. The sense of 
the transitoriness of life impels them to uninhibited revelry in order to enjoy 
life while it lasts, or else they yield to melancholy and spoil the precious time 
by lamenting the approach of old age. Both attitudes are wrong. To the 
superior man it makes no difference whether death comes early or late. He 
cultivates himself, awaits his allotted time, and in this way secures his fate.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 4th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Clarity of mind has the same relation to life that fire has to wood. Fire clings 
to wood, but also consumes it. Clarity of mind is rooted in life but can also 
consume it. Everything depends upon how the clarity functions. Here the 
image used is that of a meteor or a straw fire. A man who is excitable and 
restless may rise quickly to prominence but produces no lasting effects. Thus 
matters end badly when a man spends himself too rapidly and consumes 
himself like a meteor.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 5th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Here the zenith of life has been reached. Were there no warning, one would 
at this point consume oneself like a flame. Instead, understanding the vanity 
of all things, one may put aside both hope and fear, and sigh and lament: if 
one is intent on retaining his clarity of mind, good fortune will come from 
this grief. For here we are dealing not with a passing mood, as in the nine in 
the third place, but with a real change of heart.
 <b>
  The top line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 It is not the purpose of chastisement to impose punishment blindly but to 
create discipline. Evil must be cured at its roots. To eradicate evil in political 
life, it is best to kill the ringleaders and spare the followers. In educating 
oneself it is best to root out bad habits and tolerate those that are harmless.
For asceticism that is too strict, like sentences of undue severity, fails in its 
purpose.

 <h3>
  Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
 </h3>
 Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

 <h2>
  Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
 </h2>
 It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work — when they're not identical.
 Since these two are identical, it makes more sense to compare with the hexagram that has reversed lines (see below).

  Compare to the Reversed Lines

 You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
