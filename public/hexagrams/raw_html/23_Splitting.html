 <h2>
  Comments on the Hexagram
 </h2>
 The dark lines are about to mount upward and overthrow the last firm, light 
line by exerting a disintegrating influence on it. The inferior, dark forces 
overcome what is superior and strong, not by direct means, but by 
undermining it gradually and imperceptibly, so that it finally collapses.
 The lines of the hexagram present the image of a house, the top line being 
the roof, and because the roof is being shattered the house collapses. The 
hexagram belongs to the ninth month (October-November). The yin power 
pushes up ever more powerfully and is about to supplant the yang power 
altogether.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Judgement
 </h3>
 This pictures a time when inferior people are pushing forward and are about 
to crowd out the few remaining strong and superior men. Under these 
circumstances, which are due to the time, it is not favorable for the superior 
man to undertake anything.
 The right behavior in such adverse times is to be deduced from the images 
and their attributes. The lower trigram stands for the earth, whose attributes.
The lower trigram stands for the earth, whose attributes are docility and 
devotion. The upper trigram stands for the mountain, whose attribute is 
stillness. This suggests that one should submit to the bad time and remain 
quiet. For it is a question not of man's doing but of time conditions, which, 
according to the laws of heaven, show an alternation of increase and decrease, 
fullness and emptiness. It is impossible to counteract these conditions of the 
time. Hence it is not cowardice but wisdom to submit and avoid action.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Image
 </h3>
 The mountain rests on the earth. When it is steep and narrow, lacking a 
broad base, it must topple over. Its position is strong only when it rises out of 
the earth broad and great, not proud and steep. So likewise those who rule 
rest on the broad foundation of the people. They too should be generous and 
benevolent, like the earth that carries all. Then they will make their position 
as secure as a mountain is in its tranquillity.
 <h3>
  The Lines
 </h3>
 <b>
  The bottom line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Inferior people are on the rise and stealthily begin their destructive 
burrowing from below in order to undermine the place where the superior 
man rests. Those followers of the ruler who remain loyal are destroyed by 
slander and intrigue. The situation bodes disaster, yet there is nothing to do 
but wait.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 2nd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 The power of the inferior people is growing. The danger draws close to one's 
person; already there are clear indication, and rest is disturbed. Moreover, in 
this dangerous situation one is as yet without help or friendly advances from 
above or below. Extreme caution is necessary in this isolation. One must 
adjust to the time and promptly avoid the danger. Stubborn perseverance in 
maintaining one's standpoint would lead to downfall.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 3rd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 An individual finds himself in an evil environment to which he is 
committed by external ties. But he has an inner relationship with a superior 
man, and through this he attains the stability to free himself from the way of 
the inferior people around him. This brings him into opposition to them of 
course, but that is not wrong.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 4th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Here the disaster affects not only the resting place but even the occupant. No 
warning or other comment is added. Misfortune has reached its peak: it can 
no longer be warded off.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 5th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Here, in immediate proximity to the strong, light-giving principle at the top, 
the nature of the dark force undergoes a change. It no longer opposes the 
strong principle by means of intrigues but submits to its guidance. Indeed, as 
the head of the other weak lines, it leads all of these to the strong line, just as 
a princess leads her maids-in-waiting like a shoal of fishes to her husband and 
thus gains his favor. Inasmuch as the lower element thus voluntarily places 
itself under the higher, it attains happiness and the higher also receives its 
due. Therefore all goes well.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The top line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Here the splitting apart reaches its end. When misfortune has spent itself, 
better times return. The seed of the good remains, and it is just when the 
fruit falls to the ground that food sprouts anew from its seed. The superior 
man again attains influence and effectiveness. He is supported by public 
opinion as if in a carriage. But the inferior man's wickedness is visited upon 
himself. His house is split apart. A law of nature is at work here. Evil is not 
destructive to the good alone but inevitably destroys itself as well. For evil, 
which lives solely by negation, cannot continue to exist on its own strength 
alone. The inferior man himself fares best when held under control by a 
superior man.

 <h3>
  Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
 </h3>
 Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

  Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
 </h2>
 It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work — when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

  Compare to the Reversed Lines

 You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
