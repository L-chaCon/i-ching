 Heaven above, the lake below:

 The image of Treading.

 Thus the superior man discriminates between high and low,
 <br/>
 And thereby fortifies the thinking of the people.

  Comments on the Hexagram
 </h2>
 The name of the hexagram means on the one hand the right way of 
conducting oneself. Heaven, the father, is above, and the lake, the youngest 
daughter, is below. This shows the difference between high and low, upon 
which composure correct social conduct, depends. On the other hand the 
word for the name of the hexagram, TREADING, means literally treading 
upon something. The small and cheerful [Tui] treads upon the large and 
strong [Ch'ien]. The direction of movement of the two primary trigrams is 
upward. The fact that the strong treads on the weak is not mentioned in the 
Book of Changes, because it is taken for granted. For the weak to take a stand 
against the strong is not dangerous here, because it happened in good humor 
[Tui] and without presumption, so that the strong man is not irritated but 
takes it all in good part.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Judgement
 </h3>
 The situation is really difficult. That which is strongest and that which is 
weakest are close together. The weak follows behind the strong and worries 
it. The strong, however, acquiesces and does not hurt the weak, because the 
contact is in goof humor and harmless.
 In terms of a human situation, one is handling wild, intractable people. In 
such a case one's purpose will be achieved if one behaves with decorum.
Pleasant manners succeed even with irritable people.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Image
 </h3>
 Heaven and the lake show a difference of elevation that inheres in the 
natures of the two, hence no envy arises. Among mankind also there are 
necessarily differences of elevation; it is impossible to bring about universal 
equality. But it is important that differences in social rank should not be 
arbitrary and unjust, for if this occurs, envy and class struggle are the 
inevitable consequences. If, on the other hand, external differences in rank 
correspond with differences in inner worth, and if inner worth forms the 
criterion of external rank, people acquiesce and order reigns in society.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Lines
 </h3>
 <b>
  The bottom line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 The situation is one in which we are still not bound by any obligations of 
social intercourse. If our conduct is simple, we remain free of them We can 
quietly follow our predilections as long as we are content and make not 
demands on people.
 The meaning of the hexagram is not standstill but progress. A man finds 
himself in an altogether inferior position at the start. However, he has the 
inner strength that guarantees progress. If he can be content with simplicity, 
he can make progress without blame. When a man is dissatisfied with 
modest circumstances, he is restless and ambitious and tries to advance, not 
for the sake of accomplishing anything worth while, but merely in order to 
escape from lowliness and poverty by dint of his conduct. Once his purpose is 
achieved, he is certain to become arrogant and luxury-loving. Therefore 
blame attaches to his progress. On the other hand, a man who is good at his 
work is content to behave simply. He wishes to make progress in order to 
accomplish something. When he attains his goal, he does something worth 
while, an all is well.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 2nd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 The situation of a lonely sage is indicated here. He remains withdrawn from 
the bustle of life, seeks nothing, asks nothing of anyone, and travels through 
life unassailed, on a level road. Since he is content and does not challenge 
fate, he remains free of entanglements.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 3rd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 A one-eyed man can indeed see, but not enough for clear vision. A lame 
man can indeed treat, but not enough to make progress. If in spite of such 
defects a man considers himself strong and consequently exposes himself to 
danger, he is inviting disaster, for he is undertaking something beyond his 
strength. This reckless way of plunging ahead, regardless of the adequacy of 
one's powers, can be justified only in the case of a warrior battling for his 
prince.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 4th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 This text refers to a dangerous enterprise. The inner power to carry it through 
is there, but this inner power is combined with hesitating caution in one's 
external attitude. This line contrasts with the preceding line, which is weak 
within but outwardly presses forward. Here one is sure of ultimate success, 
which consists in achieving one's purpose, that is, in overcoming danger by 
going forward.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 5th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 This refers to the ruler of the hexagram as a whole. One sees that one has to 
be resolute in conduct. But at the same time one must remain conscious of 
the danger connected with such resoluteness, especially if it is to be 
persevered in. Only awareness of the danger makes success possible.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The top line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 The work is ended. If we want to know whether good fortune will follow, we 
must look back upon our conduct and its consequences. If the effects are good, 
then good fortune is certain. No one knows himself. It is only by the 
consequences of his actions, by the fruit of his labors, that a man can judge 
what he is to expect.

  Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
 </h3>
 Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

  Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
 </h2>
 It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work â€” when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

 You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
