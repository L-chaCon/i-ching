  The Image
 </h2>
 Heaven within the mountain:
 <br/>
 The image of The Taming Power of the Small.
 <br/>
 Thus the superior man aquaints himself with many sayings of antiquity
 <br/>
 And many deeds of the past,
 <br/>
 In order to strengthen his character thereby.

  Comments on the Hexagram
 </h2>
 The Creative is tamed by Kên, Keeping Still. This produces great power, a 
situation in contrast to that of the ninth hexagram, Hsiao Ch'u, THE 
TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL, in which the Creative is tamed by the 
Gentle alone. There one weak line must tame five strong lines, but here four 
strong lines are restrained by two weak lines; in addition to a minister, there 
is a prince, and the restraining power therefore is afar stronger.
 The hexagram has a threefold meaning, expressing different aspects of the 
concept "Holding firm." Heaven within the mountain gives the idea of 
holding firm in the sense of holding together; the trigram Kên which holds 
the trigram ch'ien still, gives the idea of holding firm in the sense of holding 
back; the third idea is that of holding firm in the sense of caring for and 
nourishing. This last is suggested by the fact that a strong line at the top, 
which is the ruler of the hexagram, is honored and tended as a sage. The third 
of these meanings also attaches specifically to this strong line at the top, 
which represents the sage.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Judgement
 </h3>
 To hold firmly to great creative powers and store them up, as set forth in this 
hexagram, there is need of a strong, clear-headed man who is honored by the 
ruler. The trigram Ch'ein points to strong creative power; Kên indicates 
firmness and truth. Both point to light and clarity and to the daily renewal of 
character. Only through such daily self-renewal can a man continue at the 
height of his powers. Force of habit helps to keep order in quiet times; but in 
periods when there is a great storing up of energy, everything depends on the 
power of the personality. However, since the worthy are honored, as in the 
case of the strong personality entrusted with leadership by the ruler, it is an 
advantage not to eat at home but rather to earn one's bread by entering upon 
public office. Such a man is in harmony with heaven; therefore even great 
and difficult undertakings, such as crossing the great water, succeed.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Image
 </h3>
 Heaven within the mountain points to hidden treasures. In the words and 
deeds of the past there lies hidden a treasure that men may use to strengthen 
and elevate their own characters. The way to study the past is not to confine 
oneself to mere knowledge of history but, through application of this 
knowledge, to give actuality to the past.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Lines
 </h3>
 <b>
  The bottom line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 A man wishes to make vigorous advance, but circumstances present an 
obstacle. He sees himself held back firmly. If he should attempt to fore an 
advance, it would lead him into misfortune. Therefore it is better for him to 
compose himself and to wait until an outlet is offered for release of his 
stored-up energies.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 2nd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Here advance is checked just as in the third line of THE TAMING POWER OF 
THE SMALL (9). However, in the later the restraining force is slight; thus a 
conflict arises between the propulsive and the restraining movement, as a 
result of which the spokes fall out of the wagon wheels, while here the 
restraining force is absolutely superior; hence no struggle takes place. One 
submits and removes the axletrees from the wagon -in other words, contents 
himself with waiting. In this way energy accumulates for a vigorous advance 
later on.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 3rd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 The way opens; the hindrance has been cleared away. A man is in contact 
with a strong will acting in the same direction as his own, and goes forward 
like one good horse following another. But danger still threatens, and he 
must remain aware of it, or he will be robbed of his firmness. Thus he must 
acquire skill on the one hand in what will take him forward, and on the other 
in what will protect him against unforeseen attacks. It is good in such a pass 
to have a goal toward which to strive.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 4th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 This line and the one following it are the two that tame the forward-pushing 
lower lines. Before a bull's horns grow out, a headboard is fastened to its 
forehead, so that later when the horns appear they cannot do harm. A good 
way to restrain wild force is to forestall it. By so doing one achieves an easy 
and great success.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 5th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Here the restraining of the impetuous forward drive is achieved in an 
indirect way. A boar's tusk is in itself dangerous, but if the boar's nature is 
altered, the tusk is no longer a menace. Thus also where men are concerned, 
wild force should not be combated directly; instead, its roots should be eradicated.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The top line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 The time of obstruction is past. The energy long dammed up by inhibition 
forces its way out and achieves great success. This refers to a man who is 
honored by the ruler and whose principles now prevail and shape the world.

 <h3>
  Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
 </h3>
 Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

  Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
 </h2>
 It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work — when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

  Compare to the Reversed Lines

 You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
