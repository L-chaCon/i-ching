  Comments on the Hexagram
 </h2>
 Above we have Chên, the eldest son, and below, Tui, the youngest daughter.
The man leads and the girl follows him in gladness. The picture is that of the 
entrance of the girl into her husband's house. In all, there are four 
hexagrams depicting the relationship between husband and wife. Hsien, 
INFLUENCE, (31), describes the attraction that a young couple have for each 
other; Hêng, DURATION (32), portrays the permanent relationships of 
marriage; Chien, DEVELOPMENT (53), reflects the protracted, ceremonious 
procedures attending THE MARRYING MAIDEN, shows a young girl under 
the guidance of an older man who marries her.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Judgement
 </h3>
 A girl who is taken into the family, but not as the chief wife, must behave 
with special caution and reserve. She must not take it upon herself to 
supplant the mistress of the house, for that would mean disorder and lead to 
untenable relationships.
 The same is true of all voluntary relationships between human beings.
While legally regulated relationships based on personal inclination depend in 
the long run entirely on tactful reserve.
 Affection as the essential principle of relatedness is of the greatest 
importance in all relationships in the world. For the union of heaven and 
earth is the origin of the whole of nature. Among human beings likewise, 
spontaneous affection is the all-inclusive principle of union.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Image
 </h3>
 Thunder stirs the water of the lake, which follows it in shimmering waves.
This symbolizes the girl who follows the man of her choice. But every 
relationship between individuals bears within it the danger that wrong turns 
may be taken, leading to endless misunderstandings and disagreements.
Therefore it is necessary constantly to remain mindful of the end. If we 
permit ourselves to drift along, we come together and are parted again as the 
day may determine. If on the other hand a man fixes his mind on an end that 
endures, he will succeed in avoiding the reefs that confront the closer 
relationships of people.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Lines
 </h3>
 <b>
  The bottom line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 The princess of ancient China maintained a fixed order of rank among the 
court ladies, who were subordinated to the queen as are younger sisters to the 
eldest. Frequently they came from the family of the queen, who herself led 
them to her husband.
 The meaning is that a girl entering a family with the consent of the wife 
will not rank outwardly as the equal of the latter but will withdraw modestly 
into the background. However, if she understands how to fit herself into the 
pattern of things, her position will be entirely satisfactory, and she will feel 
sheltered in the love of the husband to whom she bears children.
 The same meaning is brought out in the relationships between officials. A 
man may enjoy the personal friendship of a prince and be taken into his 
confidence. Outwardly this man must keep tactfully in the background 
behind the official ministers of state, but, although he is hampered by this 
status, as if he were lame, he can nevertheless accomplish something through 
the kindliness of his nature.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 2nd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Here the situation is that of a girl married to a man who has disappointed 
her. Man and wife ought to work together like a pair of eyes. Here the girl is 
left behind in loneliness; the man of her choice either has become unfaithful 
or has died. But she does not lost the inner light of loyalty. Thought the 
other eye is gone, she maintains her loyalty even in loneliness.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 3rd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 A girl who is in a lowly position and finds no husband may, in some 
circumstances, still win shelter as a concubine.
 This pictures the situation of a person who longs too much for joys that 
cannot be obtained in the usual way. He enters upon a situation not 
altogether compatible with self-esteem. Neither judgment nor warning is 
added to this line; it merely lays bare the actual situation, so that everyone 
may draw a lesson from it.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 4th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 The girl is virtuous. She does not wish to throw herself away, and allows the 
customary time for marriage to slip by. However, there is no harm in this; 
she is rewarded for her purity and, even though belatedly, finds the husband 
intended for her.
 <b>
  The 5th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 The sovereign I is T'ang the Completer. This ruler decreed that the imperial 
princesses should be subordinated to their husbands in the same manner as 
other women (cf. Hexagram 11, six in the fifth place). The emperor does not 
wait for a suitor to woo his daughter but gives her in marriage when he sees 
fit. Therefore it is in accord with custom for the girl's family to take the 
initiative here.
 We see here a girl of aristocratic birth who marries a man of modest 
circumstances and understands how to adapt herself with grace to the new 
situation. She is free of all vanity of outer adornment, and forgetting her rank 
in her marriage, takes a place below that of her husband, just as the moon, 
before it is quite full, does not directly face the sun.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The top line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 At the sacrifice to the ancestors, the woman had to present harvest offerings 
in a basket, while the man slaughtered the sacrificial animal with his own 
hand. Here the ritual is only superficially fulfilled; the woman takes an 
empty basket and the man stabs a sheep slaughtered beforehand-solely to 
preserve the forms. This impious, irreverent attitude bodes no good for a 
marriage.

 <h3>
  Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
 </h3>
 Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

  Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
 </h2>
 It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work — when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

 You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
