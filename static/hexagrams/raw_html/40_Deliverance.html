 Thunder and rain set in:
 <br/>
 The image of Deliverance.
 <br/>
 Thus the superior man pardons mistakes
 <br/>
 And forgives misdeeds.

  Comments on the Hexagram
 </h2>
 Here the movement goes out of the sphere of danger. The obstacle has been 
removed, the difficulties are being resolved. Deliverance is not yet achieved; 
it is just in its beginning, and the hexagram represents its various stages.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Judgement
 </h3>
 This refers to a time in which tensions and complications begin to be eased.
At such times we ought to make our way back to ordinary conditions as soon 
as possible; this is the meaning of "the southwest." These periods of sudden 
change have great importance. Just as rain relieves atmospheric tension, 
making all the buds burst open, so a time of deliverance from burdensome 
pressure has a liberating and stimulating effect on life. One thing is 
important, however: in such times we must not overdo our triumph. The 
point is not to push on farther than is necessary. Returning to the regular 
order of life as soon as deliverance is achieved brings good fortune. If there 
are any residual matters that ought to be attended to, it should be done as 
quickly as possible, so that a clean sweep is made and no retardations occur.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Image
 </h3>
 A thunderstorm has the effect of clearing the air; the superior man produces 
a similar effect when dealing with mistakes and sins of men that induce a 
condition of tension. Through clarity he brings deliverance. However, when 
failings come to light, he does not dwell on them; he simply passes over 
mistakes, the unintentional transgressions, just as thunder dies away. He 
forgives misdeeds, the intentional transgressions, just as water washes 
everything clean.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Lines
 </h3>
 <b>
  The bottom line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 In keeping with the situation, few words are needed. The hindrance is past, 
deliverance has come. One recuperates in peace and keeps still. This is the 
right thing to do in times when difficulties have been overcome.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 2nd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 The image is taken from the hunt. The hunter catches three cunning foxes 
and receives a yellow arrow as a reward. The obstacles in public life are the 
designing foxes who try to influence the ruler through flattery. They must be 
removed before there can be any deliverance. But the struggle must not be 
carried on with the wrong weapons. The yellow color points to measure and 
mean in proceeding against the enemy; the arrow signifies the straight course.
If one devotes himself wholeheartedly to the task of deliverance, he develops 
so much inner strength from his rectitude that it acts as a weapon against all 
that is false and low.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 3rd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 This refers to a man who has come out of needy circumstances in to comfort 
and freedom from want. If now, in the manner of an upstart, he tries to take 
his ease in comfortable surroundings that do not suit his nature, he thereby 
attracts robbers. If he goes on thus he is sure to bring disgrace upon himself.
Confucius says about this line:

Carrying a burden on the back is the business of common man; a carriage is 
the appurtenance of a man of rank. Now, when a common man uses the 
appurtenance of man of rank, robbers plot to take it away from him. If a man 
is insolent toward those above him and hard toward those below him, 
robbers plot to attack him. Carelessness in guarding things tempts thieves to 
steal. Sumptuous ornaments worn by a maiden are an enticement to rob her 
of her virtue.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 4th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 In times of standstill it will happen that inferior people attach themselves to a 
superior man, and through force of daily habit they may grow very close to 
him and become indispensable, just as the big toe is indispensable to the foot 
because it makes walking easier. But when the time of deliverance draws 
near, with its call to deeds, a man must free himself from such chance 
acquaintances with whim he has no inner connection. For otherwise the 
friends who share his views, on whom he could really rely and together with 
whom he could accomplish something, mistrust him and stay away.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 5th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Times of deliverance demand inner resolve. Inferior people cannot be 
driven off by prohibitions or any external means. If one desires to be rid of 
them, he must first break completely with them in his own mind; they will 
see for themselves that he is in earnest and will withdraw.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The top line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 The hawk on a high wall is the symbol of a powerful inferior in a high 
position who is hindering the deliverance. He withstands the force of inner 
influences, because he is hardened in his wickedness. He must be forcibly 
removed, and this requires appropriate means. Confucius says about this 
line:

The hawk is the object of the hunt; bow and arrow are the tools and means.
The marksman is man (who must make proper use of the means to his end).
The superior man contains the means in his own person. He bides his time 
and then acts. Why then should not everything go well? He acts and is free.
Therefore all he has to do is to go forth, and he takes his quarry. This is how a 
man fares who acts after he has made ready the means.

 <h3>
  Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
 </h3>
 Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

  Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
 </h2>
 It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work — when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

 You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
