 <h2>
  Comments on the Hexagram
 </h2>
 Chên is movement; Li is flame, whose attribute is clarity. Clarity within, 
movement without-this produces greatness and abundance. The hexagram 
pictures a period of advanced civilization. However, the fact that 
development has reached a peak suggests that this extraordinary condition of 
abundance cannot be maintained permanently.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Judgement
 </h3>
 It is not given to every mortal to bring about a time of outstanding greatness 
and abundance. Only a born ruler of men is able to do it, because his will is 
directed to what is great. Such a time of abundance is usually brief. Therefore 
a sage might well feel sad in view of the decline that must follow. But such 
sadness foes not befit him. Only a man who is inwardly free of sorrow and 
care can lead in a time of abundance. He must be like the sun at midday, 
illuminating and gladdening everything under heaven.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Image
 </h3>
 This hexagram has a certain connection with Shih Ho, BITING THROUGH 
(21), in which thunder and lightning similarly appear together, but in the 
reverse order. In BITING THROUGH, laws are laid down; here they are 
applied and enforced. Clarity [Li] within makes it possible to investigate the 
facts exactly, and shock [Chên] without ensures a strict and precise carrying 
out of punishments.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Lines
 </h3>
 <b>
  The bottom line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 To bring about a time of abundance, a union of clarity with energetic 
movement is needed. Two individuals possessed of these two attributes are 
suited to each other, and even if they spend an entire cycle of time together 
during the period of abundance, it will not be too long, nor is it a mistake.
Therefore one may go forth, in order to make one's influence felt; it will meet 
with recognition.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 2nd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 It often happens that plots and party intrigues, which have the darkening 
effect of an eclipse of the sun, come between a ruler intent on great 
achievement and the man who could effect great undertakings. Then, 
instead of the sun, we see the northern stars in the sky. The ruler is 
overshadowed by a party that has usurped power. If a man at such a time 
were to try to take energetic measures, he would encounter only mistrust and 
envy, which would prohibit all movement. The essential thing then is to 
hold inwardly to the power of truth, which in the end is so strong that it 
exerts an invisible influence on the ruler, so that all goes well.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 3rd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 The image is that of a progressive covering over of the sun. Here the eclipse 
reaches totality, therefore even the small stars can be seen at noon.
 In the sphere of social relationships, this means that the prince is now so 
eclipsed that even the most insignificant persons can push themselves into 
the foreground. This makes it impossible for an able man, though he might 
be the right hand of the ruler, to undertake anything. It is as though his arm 
were broken, but he is not to blame for being thus hindered in action.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 4th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Here the darkness is already decreasing, therefore interrelated elements come 
together. Here too the complement must be found-the necessary wisdom to 
complement joy of action. Then everything will go well. The 
complementary factor postulated here is the reverse of the one in the first 
line. In the latter, wisdom is to be complemented by energy, while here 
energy is complemented by wisdom.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 5th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 The ruler is modest and therefore open to the counsel of able men. Thus he 
is surrounded by men who suggest to him the lines of action. This brings 
blessing, fame, and good fortune to him and all the people.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The top line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 This describes a man who because of his arrogance and obstinacy attains the 
opposite of what he strives for. He seeks abundance and splendor for his 
dwelling. He wishes at all odds to be master in his house, which so alienates 
his family that in the end he finds himself completely isolated.

 <h3>
  Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
 </h3>
 Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

  Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
 </h2>
 It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work — when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

  Compare to the Reversed Lines

 You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
