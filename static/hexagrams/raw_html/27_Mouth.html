 <h2>
  Comments on the Hexagram
 </h2>
 This hexagram is a picture of an open mouth; above and below are firm lines 
of the lips, and between them the opening. Starting with the mouth, through 
which we take food for nourishment, the thought leads to nourishment 
itself. Nourishment of oneself, specifically of the body, is represented in the 
three lower lines, while the three upper lines represent nourishment and 
care of others, in a higher, spiritual sense.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Judgement
 </h3>
 In bestowing care and nourishment, it is important that the right people 
should be taken care of and that we should attend to our own nourishment 
in the right way. If we wish to know what anyone is like, we have only to 
observe on whom he bestows his care and what sides of his own nature he 
cultivates and nourishes. Nature nourishes all creatures. The great man 
fosters and takes care of superior men, in order to take care of all men 
through them. Mencius says about this:

If we wish to know whether anyone is superior or not, we need only observe 
what part of his being he regards as especially important. The body has 
superior and inferior, important and unimportant parts. We must not injure 
important parts for the sake of the unimportant, nor must we injure the 
superior parts for the sake of the inferior. He who cultivates the inferior parts 
of his nature is an inferior man. He who cultivates the superior parts of his 
nature is a superior man.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Image
 </h3>
 "God comes forth in the sign of the Arousing": when in the spring the life 
forces stir again, all things comes into being anew. "He brings to perfection in 
the sign of Keeping Still": thus in the early spring, when the seeds fall to 
earth, all things are made ready. This is an image of providing nourishment 
through movement and tranquillity. The superior man takes it as a pattern 
for the nourishment and cultivation of his character. Words are a movement 
going form within outward. Eating and drinking are movements from 
without inward. Both kinds of movement can be modified by tranquillity.
For tranquillity keeps the words that come out of the mouth from exceeding 
proper measure, and keeps the food that goes into the mouth from exceeding 
its proper measure. Thus character is cultivated.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Lines
 </h3>
 <b>
  The bottom line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 The magic tortoise is a creature possessed of such supernatural powers that it 
lives on air and needs no earthly nourishment. The image means that a man 
fitted by nature and position to live freely and independently renounces this 
self-reliance and instead looks with envy and discontent at others who are 
outwardly in better circumstances. But such base envy only arouses derision 
and contempt in those others. This has bad results.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 2nd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Normally a person either provides his own means of nourishment or is 
supported in a proper way by those whose duty of privilege it is to provide for 
him. If, owing to weakness of spirit, a man cannot support himself, a feeling 
of uneasiness comes over him; this is because in shirking the proper way of 
obtaining a living, he accepts support as a favor from those in higher place.
This is unworthy, for he is deviating from his true nature. Kept up 
indefinitely, this course leads to misfortune.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 3rd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 He who seeks nourishment that does not nourish reels from desire to 
gratification and in gratification craves desire. Mad pursuit of pleasure for the 
satisfaction of the senses never brings one to the goal. One should never (ten 
years is a complete cycle of time) follow this path, for nothing good can come 
of it.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 4th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 In contrast to the six in the second place, which refers to a man bent 
exclusively on his own advantage, this line refers to one occupying a high 
position and striving to let his light sine forth. To do this he needs helpers, 
because he cannot attain his lofty aim alone. With the greed of a hungry tiger 
he is on the lookout for the right people. Since he is not working for himself 
but for the good of all, there is no wrong in such zeal.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 5th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 A man may be conscious of a deficiency in himself. He should be 
undertaking the nourishment of the people, but he has not the strength to do 
it. Thus he must turn from his accustomed path and beg counsel and help 
from a man who is spiritually his superior but undistinguished outwardly. If 
he maintains this attitude of mind perseveringly, success and good fortune 
are his. But he must remain aware of his dependence. He must not put his 
own person forward nor attempt great labors, such as crossing the great water.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The top line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 This describes a sage of the highest order, from whom emanate all influences 
that provide nourishment for others. Such a position brings with it heavy 
responsibility. If he remains conscious of this fact, he has good fortune and 
may confidently undertake even great and difficult labors, such as crossing 
the great water. These undertakings bring general happiness for him and for 
all others.

 <h3>
  Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
 </h3>
 Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

  Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
 </h2>
 It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work — when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

  Compare to the Reversed Lines

 You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
