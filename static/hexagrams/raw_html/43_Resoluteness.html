 The lake has risen up to heaven:
 <br/>
 The image of Break-through.
 <br/>
 Thus the superior man
 <br/>
 Dispenses riches downward
 <br/>
 And refrains from resting on his virtue.

  Comments on the Hexagram
 </h2>
 This hexagram signifies on the one hand a break-through after a long 
accumulation of tension, as a swollen river breaks through its dikes, or in the 
manner of a cloudburst. On the other hand, applied to human conditions, it 
refers to the time when inferior people gradually begin to disappear. Their 
influence is on the wane; as a result of resolute action, a change in conditions 
occurs, a break-through. The hexagram is linked with the third month 
[April-May].
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Judgement
 </h3>
 Even if only one inferior man is occupying a ruling position in a city, he is 
able to oppress superior men. Even a single passion still lurking in the heart 
has power to obscure reason. Passion and reason cannot exist side by side-
therefore fight without quarter is necessary if the good is to prevail.
 In a resolute struggle of the good against evil, there are, however, definite 
rules that must not be disregarded, if it is to succeed. First, resolution must be 
based on a union of strength and friendliness. Second, a compromise with 
evil is not possible; evil must under all circumstances be openly discredited.
Nor must our own passions and shortcomings be glossed over. Third, the 
struggle must not be carried on directly by force. If evil is branded, it thinks of 
weapons, and if we do it the favor of fighting against it blow for blow, we lose 
in the end because thus we ourselves get entangled in hatred and passion.
Therefore it is important to begin at home, to be on guard in our own persons 
against the faults we have branded. In this way, finding no opponent, the 
sharp edges of the weapons of evil becomes dulled. For the same reasons we 
should not combat our own faults directly. As long as we wrestle with them, 
they continue victorious. Finally, the best way to fight evil is to make 
energetic progress in the good.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Image
 </h3>
 When the water of a lake has risen up to heaven, there is reason to fear a 
cloudburst. Taking this as a warning, the superior man forestalls a violent 
collapse. If a man were to pile up riches for himself alone, without 
considering others, he would certainly experience a collapse. If a man were to 
pile up riches for himself alone, without considering others, he would 
certainly experience a collapse. For all gathering is followed by dispersion.
Therefore the superior man begins to distribute while he is accumulating. In 
the same way, in developing his character he takes care not to become 
hardened in obstinacy but to remain receptive to impressions by help of strict 
and continuous self-examination.
 <br/>
 <h3>
  The Lines
 </h3>
 <b>
  The bottom line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 In times of resolute advance, the beginning is especially difficult. We feel 
inspired to press forward but resistance is still strong; therefore we ought to 
gauge our own strength and venture only so far as we can go with certainty of 
success. To plunge blindly ahead is wrong, because it is precisely at the 
beginning that an unexpected setback can have the most disastrous results.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 2nd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Readiness is everything. Resolution is indissolubly bound up with caution.
If an individual is careful and keeps his wits about him, he need not become 
excited or alarmed. If he is watchful at all times, even before danger is present, 
he is armed when danger approaches and need not be afraid. The superior 
man is on his guard against what is not yet in sight and on the alert for what 
is not yet within hearing; therefore he dwells in the midst of difficulties as 
thought hey did not exist. If a man develops his character, people submit to 
him of their own accord. If reason triumphs, the passions withdraw of 
themselves. To be circumspect and not to forget one's armor is the right way 
to security.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 3rd line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Here we have a man in an ambiguous situation. While all others are 
engaged in a resolute fight against all that is inferior, he alone has a certain 
relationship with an inferior man. If he were to show strength outwardly 
and turn against this man before the time is ripe, he would only endanger the 
entire situation, because the inferior man would too quickly have recourse to 
countermeasures. The task of the superior man becomes extremely difficult 
here. He must be firmly resolved within himself and, while maintaining 
association with the inferior man, avoid any participation in his evilness. He 
will of course be misjudged. It will be thought that he belong to the party of 
the inferior man. He will be lonely because no one will understand him. His 
relations with the inferior man will sully him in the eyes of the multitude, 
and they will turn against him, grumbling. But he can endure this lack of 
appreciation and makes no mistake, because he remains true to himself.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 4th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Here a man is suffering from inner restlessness and cannot abide in his place.
He would like to push forward under any circumstances, but encounters 
insuperable obstacles. Thus his situation entails an inner conflict. This is due 
to the obstinacy with which he seeks to enforce his will. If he would desist 
from this obstinacy, everything would go well. But this advice, like so much 
other good counsel, will be ignored. For obstinacy makes a man unable to 
hear, for all that he has ears.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The 5th line from the bottom marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Weeds always grow back again and are difficult to exterminate. So too the 
struggle against an inferior man in a high position demands firm resolution.
One has certain relations with him, hence there is danger that one may give 
up the struggle as hopeless. But this must not be. One must go on resolutely 
and not allow himself to be deflected from him course. Only in this way does 
one remain free of blame.
 <br/>
 <b>
  The top line marked
 </b>
 <br/>
 Victory seems to have been achieved. There remains merely a remnant of 
the evil resolutely to be eradicated as the time demands. Everything looks 
easy. Just there, however, lies the danger. If we are not on guard, evil will 
succeed in escaping by means of concealment, and when it has eluded us new 
misfortunes will develop from the remaining seeds, for evil does not die 
easily. So too in dealing with the evil in own's own character, one must go to 
work with thoroughness. If out of carelessness anything were to be 
overlooked, new evil would arise from it.

 <h3>
  Meaning of the Trigrams Combined
 </h3>
 Each hexagram combines two trigrams, making one the upper and the other the lower. The meaning of the hexagram is mainly derived from that combination. Here's what it means for this hexagram:

  Compare to the Reversed Trigrams
 </h2>
 It's common to compare a hexagram to the one where the lines are the opposite: a full line is broken and a broken line full. But I find it much more interesting to compare hexagrams with the trigrams reversed: the upper trigram becomes the lower, and the lower trigram becomes the upper. That deepens the understanding of the trigrams at work â€” when they're not identical. Click the image to see what it means for the two trigrams of this hexagram:

 You can also compare this hexagram to its opposite according to the six lines, where each broken line is full, and vice versa. In some cases it leads to the same hexagram as the one where the trigrams are switched. Here is the hexagram with reversed lines (click it to get to its webpage):
